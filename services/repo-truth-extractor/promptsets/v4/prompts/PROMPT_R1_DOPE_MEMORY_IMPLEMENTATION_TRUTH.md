# PROMPT_R1

## Goal
Produce `R1` outputs for phase `R` with strict schema, explicit evidence, and deterministic normalization.
Focus on concrete, machine-verifiable implementation facts.

## Inputs
- Source scope (scan these roots first):
- `extraction/**/norm/**`
- `docs/**`
- `services/repo-truth-extractor/**`
- Upstream normalized artifacts available to this step:
- `CONTROL_PLANE_TRUTH_MAP.md`
- Runner context artifacts:
  - `extraction/*/inputs/INVENTORY.json`
  - `extraction/*/inputs/PARTITIONS.json`
  - `services/repo-truth-extractor/promptsets/v4/promptset.yaml`
  - `services/repo-truth-extractor/promptsets/v4/artifacts.yaml`
- When relevant, use `services/registry.yaml` as canonical service list.

## Outputs
- `DOPE_MEMORY_IMPLEMENTATION_TRUTH.md`
- `DOPE_MEMORY_SCHEMAS.json`
- `DOPE_MEMORY_DB_WRITES.json`

## Schema
- Use deterministic containers only:
  - `ItemList`: `{"schema":"<schema_id>@v1","items":[...]}`
  - `Graph`: `{"schema":"<schema_id>@v1","nodes":[...],"edges":[...]}`
- Output contracts:
  - `DOPE_MEMORY_IMPLEMENTATION_TRUTH.md`
    - `kind`: `markdown`
    - `merge_strategy`: `markdown_concat`
    - `canonical_writer_step_id`: `R1`
    - `id_rule`: `DOPE_MEMORY_IMPLEMENTATION_TRUTH:<stable-hash(path|symbol|name)>`
    - `required_item_fields`: `id, evidence`
  - `DOPE_MEMORY_SCHEMAS.json`
    - `kind`: `json_item_list`
    - `merge_strategy`: `itemlist_by_id`
    - `canonical_writer_step_id`: `R1`
    - `id_rule`: `DOPE_MEMORY_SCHEMAS:<stable-hash(path|symbol|name)>`
    - `required_item_fields`: `id, evidence, path, line_range`
    - `required_registry_fields`: `path, line_range, id`
  - `DOPE_MEMORY_DB_WRITES.json`
    - `kind`: `json_item_list`
    - `merge_strategy`: `itemlist_by_id`
    - `canonical_writer_step_id`: `R1`
    - `id_rule`: `DOPE_MEMORY_DB_WRITES:<stable-hash(path|symbol|name)>`
    - `required_item_fields`: `id, evidence, path, line_range`
    - `required_registry_fields`: `path, line_range, id`

## Extraction Procedure
1. Enumerate candidate facts only from in-scope inputs and upstream artifacts.
2. Build deterministic IDs using stable content keys (path/symbol/name/service_id).
3. Attach evidence to every non-derived field and every relationship edge.
4. Normalize arrays by stable sort keys; deduplicate by ID (or stable content hash).
5. Validate required fields; emit `UNKNOWN` for unsatisfied values with evidence gaps.
6. Emit exactly the declared outputs and no additional files.

## Evidence Rules
- Every load-bearing value must carry at least one evidence object:
```json
{
  "path": "<repo-relative-path>",
  "line_range": [<start>, <end>],
  "excerpt": "<exact substring <=200 chars>"
}
```
- `path` must be repo-relative (never absolute in norm artifacts).
- `excerpt` must be exact (no paraphrase) and <= 200 chars.
- If the source is ambiguous, include multiple evidence objects and set value to `UNKNOWN`.

## Determinism Rules
- Norm outputs MUST NOT contain: `generated_at`, `timestamp`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `run_id`.
- Sort `items` by `(path, line_start, id)` when available; otherwise by `id` then stable JSON text.
- Merge duplicates deterministically:
  - union evidence by `(path,line_range,excerpt)`
  - union arrays with stable sort
  - choose scalar conflicts by non-empty, else lexicographically smallest stable value
- Output byte content must be reproducible for same commit + same configuration.

## Anti-Fabrication Rules
- Do not invent endpoints, handlers, dependencies, env vars, commands, or policy claims.
- Do not infer intent from filenames alone; require direct textual/code evidence.
- If required evidence is missing, keep item with `UNKNOWN` fields and `missing_evidence_reason`.
- Never copy unsupported keys from upstream QA artifacts into norm artifacts.

## Failure Modes
- Missing input files: emit valid empty containers plus `missing_inputs` list in output items.
- Partial scan coverage: emit partial results with explicit `coverage_notes` and evidence gaps.
- Schema violation risk: drop unverifiable fields, keep item `id` + `evidence` + `UNKNOWN` placeholders.
- Parse/runtime ambiguity: keep all plausible candidates but mark `status: needs_review` with evidence.

## Legacy Context (for intent only; never as evidence)
```markdown
Goal: DOPE_MEMORY_IMPLEMENTATION_TRUTH.md

ROLE: Supervisor/Auditor.
HARD RULE: Reason only from normalized A/H/D/C artifacts.

TASK:
Produce memory implementation truth for current system behavior.

MUST INCLUDE:
- Stores/adapters (sqlite/postgres/other)
- Schema objects from DOPE_MEMORY_SCHEMAS.json
- Write paths from DOPE_MEMORY_DB_WRITES.json
- Retention/TTL enforcement points
- Replay/re-derive surfaces (if present)
- Control-plane dependencies (env vars, compose wiring, home DBs)

FORMAT:
1) IMPLEMENTED (CODE evidence)
2) PLANNED (DOC evidence)
3) GAPS/CONFLICTS (both sides cited)
4) Minimal verification command suggestions

RULES:
- Cite statements for tables/triggers/enforcement points.
- If docs conflict, use DOC_SUPERSESSION then recency tie-breaker.
