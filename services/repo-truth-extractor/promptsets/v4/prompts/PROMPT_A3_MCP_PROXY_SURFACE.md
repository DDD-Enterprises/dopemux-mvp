# PROMPT_A3

## Goal
Produce `A3` outputs for phase `A` with strict schema, explicit evidence, and deterministic normalization.
Focus on concrete, machine-verifiable implementation facts.

## Inputs
- Source scope (scan these roots first):
- `.claude/**`
- `.github/**`
- `.taskx/**`
- `config/**`
- `scripts/**`
- `docker/**`
- `compose.yml`
- `docker-compose*.yml`
- `README.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- Upstream normalized artifacts available to this step:
- `REPOCTRL_INVENTORY.json`
- `REPOCTRL_PARTITIONS.json`
- `REPO_INSTRUCTION_SURFACE.json`
- `REPO_INSTRUCTION_REFERENCES.json`
- `REPO_MCP_SERVER_DEFS.json`
- Runner context artifacts:
  - `extraction/*/inputs/INVENTORY.json`
  - `extraction/*/inputs/PARTITIONS.json`
  - `services/repo-truth-extractor/promptsets/v4/promptset.yaml`
  - `services/repo-truth-extractor/promptsets/v4/artifacts.yaml`
- When relevant, use `services/registry.yaml` as canonical service list.

## Outputs
- `REPO_MCP_PROXY_SURFACE.json`

## Schema
- Use deterministic containers only:
  - `ItemList`: `{"schema":"<schema_id>@v1","items":[...]}`
  - `Graph`: `{"schema":"<schema_id>@v1","nodes":[...],"edges":[...]}`
- Output contracts:
  - `REPO_MCP_PROXY_SURFACE.json`
    - `kind`: `json_item_list`
    - `merge_strategy`: `itemlist_by_id`
    - `canonical_writer_step_id`: `A99`
    - `id_rule`: `REPO_MCP_PROXY_SURFACE:<stable-hash(path|symbol|name)>`
    - `required_item_fields`: `id, component, symbol, path, line_range, evidence`
    - `required_registry_fields`: `path, line_range, id`

## Extraction Procedure
1. Scan in-scope roots for proxy/gateway config files (nginx, envoy, traefik, caddy, MCP wrapper scripts).
2. Cross-reference `REPO_MCP_SERVER_DEFS.json` to identify which MCP servers have an intermediary proxy layer.
3. Extract endpoint URIs, listen ports, and route rules from each discovered proxy config with evidence.
4. Map upstream targets by matching proxy backends to server defs or `services/registry.yaml` entries.
5. Extract authentication method per route (API key, OAuth, mTLS, none) only when explicitly declared.
6. Identify multiplexing or fan-out patterns where one proxy endpoint dispatches to multiple MCP servers.
7. Resolve config layering: compose overrides, env-var substitution, and wrapper-script indirection.
8. Legacy Context is intent guidance only and is never evidence.
9. Enumerate candidate facts only from in-scope inputs and upstream artifacts.
10. Build deterministic IDs using stable content keys (path/symbol/name/service_id).
11. Attach evidence to every non-derived field and every relationship edge.
12. Normalize arrays by stable sort keys; deduplicate by ID (or stable content hash).
13. Validate required fields; emit `UNKNOWN` for unsatisfied values with evidence gaps.
14. Emit exactly the declared outputs and no additional files.

## Evidence Rules
- Every load-bearing value must carry at least one evidence object:
```json
{
  "path": "<repo-relative-path>",
  "line_range": [<start>, <end>],
  "excerpt": "<exact substring <=200 chars>"
}
```
- `path` must be repo-relative (never absolute in norm artifacts).
- `excerpt` must be exact (no paraphrase) and <= 200 chars.
- If the source is ambiguous, include multiple evidence objects and set value to `UNKNOWN`.

## Determinism Rules
- Norm outputs MUST NOT contain: `generated_at`, `timestamp`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `run_id`.
- Sort `items` by `(path, line_start, id)` when available; otherwise by `id` then stable JSON text.
- Merge duplicates deterministically:
  - union evidence by `(path,line_range,excerpt)`
  - union arrays with stable sort
  - choose scalar conflicts by non-empty, else lexicographically smallest stable value
- Output byte content must be reproducible for same commit + same configuration.

## Anti-Fabrication Rules
- Do not invent endpoints, handlers, dependencies, env vars, commands, or policy claims.
- Do not infer intent from filenames alone; require direct textual/code evidence.
- If required evidence is missing, keep item with `UNKNOWN` fields and `missing_evidence_reason`.
- Never copy unsupported keys from upstream QA artifacts into norm artifacts.

## Failure Modes
- Missing input files: emit valid empty containers plus `missing_inputs` list in output items.
- Partial scan coverage: emit partial results with explicit `coverage_notes` and evidence gaps.
- Schema violation risk: drop unverifiable fields, keep item `id` + `evidence` + `UNKNOWN` placeholders.
- Parse/runtime ambiguity: keep all plausible candidates but mark `status: needs_review` with evidence.

## Legacy Context (for intent only; never as evidence)

# PROMPT: A3 - MCP Proxy Surface

Phase: A
Step: A3

Outputs:
- REPO_MCP_PROXY_SURFACE.json

Mode: extraction
Strict: evidence_only
Format: JSON only (no markdown fences)

Hard rules:
1) Do NOT invent. If not present, write "UNKNOWN".
2) Every non-trivial field must include "evidence" with source_path and either key_path or excerpt.
3) Emit ONLY valid JSON. No commentary.

Input:
You will receive repo control-plane files. Extract only what is explicitly evidenced.

Required JSON shape:
{
  "artifact": "REPO_MCP_PROXY_SURFACE.json",
  "phase": "A",
  "step": "A3",
  "generated_at": "<iso8601>",
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "mcp-proxy:<name_or_path>",
      "proxy_name": "...",
      "endpoint": "...",
      "upstream_targets": ["..."],
      "routes": ["..."],
      "auth_method": "...",
      "evidence": [
        {
          "source_path": "...",
          "key_path": "...",
          "excerpt": "..."
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "unknowns": ["..."]
}

Extract:
- Proxy config between clients/Dopemux and MCP servers
- Endpoints, routing rules, upstream targets, auth handling (only if explicit)
- Config search order hints only if explicit
```
