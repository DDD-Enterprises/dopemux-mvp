# PROMPT_R5

## Goal
Produce `R5` outputs for phase `R` with strict schema, explicit evidence, and deterministic normalization.
Focus on concrete, machine-verifiable implementation facts.

## Inputs
- Source scope (scan these roots first):
- `extraction/**/norm/**`
- `docs/**`
- `services/repo-truth-extractor/**`
- Upstream normalized artifacts available to this step:
- `CONTROL_PLANE_TRUTH_MAP.md`
- `DOPE_MEMORY_IMPLEMENTATION_TRUTH.md`
- `DOPE_MEMORY_SCHEMAS.json`
- `DOPE_MEMORY_DB_WRITES.json`
- `EVENTBUS_WIRING_TRUTH.md`
- `TRINITY_BOUNDARY_ENFORCEMENT_TRACE.md`
- `TASKX_INTEGRATION_TRUTH.md`
- Runner context artifacts:
  - `extraction/*/inputs/INVENTORY.json`
  - `extraction/*/inputs/PARTITIONS.json`
  - `services/repo-truth-extractor/promptsets/v4/promptset.yaml`
  - `services/repo-truth-extractor/promptsets/v4/artifacts.yaml`
- When relevant, use `services/registry.yaml` as canonical service list.

## Outputs
- `WORKFLOWS_TRUTH_GRAPH.md`

## Schema
- Use deterministic containers only:
  - `ItemList`: `{"schema":"<schema_id>@v1","items":[...]}`
  - `Graph`: `{"schema":"<schema_id>@v1","nodes":[...],"edges":[...]}`
- Output contracts:
  - `WORKFLOWS_TRUTH_GRAPH.md`
    - `kind`: `markdown`
    - `merge_strategy`: `markdown_concat`
    - `canonical_writer_step_id`: `R5`
    - `id_rule`: `WORKFLOWS_TRUTH_GRAPH:<stable-hash(path|symbol|name)>`
    - `required_item_fields`: `nodes, edges, schema`

## Extraction Procedure
1. Load all relevant merged phase artifacts as synthesis inputs for workflows truth graph
2. Synthesize WORKFLOWS_TRUTH_GRAPH: combine extracted facts into a coherent truth document organized by domain category
3. For each element, produce prose summary with: what it does, where configured, dependencies, and risks
4. Cross-reference with governance and QA artifacts to annotate enforcement and coverage status
5. Embed evidence citations as inline references throughout the document
6. Legacy Context is intent guidance only and is never evidence.
7. Enumerate candidate facts only from in-scope inputs and upstream artifacts.
8. Build deterministic IDs using stable content keys (path/symbol/name/service_id).
9. Attach evidence to every non-derived field and every relationship edge.
10. Normalize arrays by stable sort keys; deduplicate by ID (or stable content hash).
11. Validate required fields; emit `UNKNOWN` for unsatisfied values with evidence gaps.
12. Emit exactly the declared outputs and no additional files.

## Evidence Rules
- Every load-bearing value must carry at least one evidence object:
```json
{
  "path": "<repo-relative-path>",
  "line_range": [<start>, <end>],
  "excerpt": "<exact substring <=200 chars>"
}
```
- `path` must be repo-relative (never absolute in norm artifacts).
- `excerpt` must be exact (no paraphrase) and <= 200 chars.
- If the source is ambiguous, include multiple evidence objects and set value to `UNKNOWN`.

## Determinism Rules
- Norm outputs MUST NOT contain: `generated_at`, `timestamp`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `run_id`.
- Sort `items` by `(path, line_start, id)` when available; otherwise by `id` then stable JSON text.
- Merge duplicates deterministically:
  - union evidence by `(path,line_range,excerpt)`
  - union arrays with stable sort
  - choose scalar conflicts by non-empty, else lexicographically smallest stable value
- Output byte content must be reproducible for same commit + same configuration.

## Anti-Fabrication Rules
- Do not invent endpoints, handlers, dependencies, env vars, commands, or policy claims.
- Do not infer intent from filenames alone; require direct textual/code evidence.
- If required evidence is missing, keep item with `UNKNOWN` fields and `missing_evidence_reason`.
- Never copy unsupported keys from upstream QA artifacts into norm artifacts.

## Failure Modes
- Missing input files: emit valid empty containers plus `missing_inputs` list in output items.
- Partial scan coverage: emit partial results with explicit `coverage_notes` and evidence gaps.
- Schema violation risk: drop unverifiable fields, keep item `id` + `evidence` + `UNKNOWN` placeholders.
- Parse/runtime ambiguity: keep all plausible candidates but mark `status: needs_review` with evidence.
- Incomplete synthesis input: if key phase data is missing, produce partial document and note gaps in header
- Conflicting truth: if sources contradict, present both versions with evidence and flag as `status: conflict`

## Legacy Context (for intent only; never as evidence)
```markdown
Goal: WORKFLOWS_TRUTH_GRAPH.md

ROLE: Supervisor/Auditor.
HARD RULE: Reason only from normalized A/H/D/C artifacts.

TASK:
Produce workflow truth graph.

MUST INCLUDE:
- Bootstrap flows (tmux, compose, scripts)
- Multi-service workflows with order/dependencies
- Inputs/outputs/artifacts where explicit
- Instruction-file-driven workflow steps

OUTPUT:
- Workflow list (W1..Wn) with literal steps + citations
- Services involved per workflow
- UNKNOWN markers where evidence is missing

RULES:
- No inferred steps.
- Use WORKFLOW_RUNNER_SURFACE + HOME_TMUX_WORKFLOW_SURFACE + compose graph evidence.
