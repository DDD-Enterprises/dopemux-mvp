# PROMPT_W3

## Goal
Produce `W3` outputs for phase `W` with strict schema, explicit evidence, and deterministic normalization.
Focus on executable workflows, runbooks, and multi-service coordination boundaries.

## Inputs
- Source scope (scan these roots first):
- `scripts/**`
- `services/**`
- `docs/02-how-to/**`
- `docs/03-reference/**`
- `compose.yml`
- Upstream normalized artifacts available to this step:
- `WORKFLOW_INVENTORY.json`
- `WORKFLOW_PARTITIONS.json`
- `WORKFLOW_CATALOG.json`
- `WORKFLOW_IO_MAP.json`
- Runner context artifacts:
  - `extraction/*/inputs/INVENTORY.json`
  - `extraction/*/inputs/PARTITIONS.json`
  - `services/repo-truth-extractor/promptsets/v4/promptset.yaml`
  - `services/repo-truth-extractor/promptsets/v4/artifacts.yaml`
- When relevant, use `services/registry.yaml` as canonical service list.

## Outputs
- `WORKFLOW_COORDINATION_SURFACE.json`

## Schema
- Use deterministic containers only:
  - `ItemList`: `{"schema":"<schema_id>@v1","items":[...]}`
  - `Graph`: `{"schema":"<schema_id>@v1","nodes":[...],"edges":[...]}`
- Output contracts:
  - `WORKFLOW_COORDINATION_SURFACE.json`
    - `kind`: `json_item_list`
    - `merge_strategy`: `itemlist_by_id`
    - `canonical_writer_step_id`: `W3`
    - `id_rule`: `WORKFLOW_COORDINATION_SURFACE:<stable-hash(path|symbol|name)>`
    - `required_item_fields`: `id, component, symbol, path, line_range, evidence`
    - `required_registry_fields`: `path, line_range, id`

## Extraction Procedure
1. Load upstream W-phase artifacts (inventory, catalog, I/O map) as specified in the inputs section. Extract multi-service coordination surfaces from compose files (`depends_on`, `links`, network definitions, volume mounts), tmux session configs (pane commands, split layouts), and startup scripts (service ordering, wait-for patterns).
2. For each coordination surface, identify: participating services, startup ordering constraints, health-check gates, port bindings, shared volumes/networks, and inter-service communication channels.
3. Map coordination surfaces to workflow catalog entries, linking compose services to their corresponding workflow steps and tmux panes to their managed processes.
4. Structure the output with clear coordination surface entries, service-to-workflow mappings with evidence, and an explicit UNKNOWN section for coordination patterns that cannot be fully resolved from available sources.
5. Legacy Context is intent guidance only and is never evidence.
6. Enumerate candidate facts only from in-scope inputs and upstream artifacts.
7. Build deterministic IDs using stable content keys (path/symbol/name/service_id).
8. Attach evidence to every non-derived field and every relationship edge.
9. Normalize arrays by stable sort keys; deduplicate by ID (or stable content hash).
10. Validate required fields; emit `UNKNOWN` for unsatisfied values with evidence gaps.
11. Emit exactly the declared outputs and no additional files.

## Evidence Rules
- Every load-bearing value must carry at least one evidence object:
```json
{
  "path": "<repo-relative-path>",
  "line_range": [<start>, <end>],
  "excerpt": "<exact substring <=200 chars>"
}
```
- `path` must be repo-relative (never absolute in norm artifacts).
- `excerpt` must be exact (no paraphrase) and <= 200 chars.
- If the source is ambiguous, include multiple evidence objects and set value to `UNKNOWN`.

## Determinism Rules
- Norm outputs MUST NOT contain: `generated_at`, `timestamp`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `run_id`.
- Sort `items` by `(path, line_start, id)` when available; otherwise by `id` then stable JSON text.
- Merge duplicates deterministically:
  - union evidence by `(path,line_range,excerpt)`
  - union arrays with stable sort
  - choose scalar conflicts by non-empty, else lexicographically smallest stable value
- Output byte content must be reproducible for same commit + same configuration.

## Anti-Fabrication Rules
- Do not invent endpoints, handlers, dependencies, env vars, commands, or policy claims.
- Do not infer intent from filenames alone; require direct textual/code evidence.
- If required evidence is missing, keep item with `UNKNOWN` fields and `missing_evidence_reason`.
- Never copy unsupported keys from upstream QA artifacts into norm artifacts.

## Failure Modes
- Missing input files: emit valid empty containers plus `missing_inputs` list in output items.
- Partial scan coverage: emit partial results with explicit `coverage_notes` and evidence gaps.
- Schema violation risk: drop unverifiable fields, keep item `id` + `evidence` + `UNKNOWN` placeholders.
- Parse/runtime ambiguity: keep all plausible candidates but mark `status: needs_review` with evidence.
- Compose service references a network or volume not defined in the same file: record as external reference with `status: external_dependency` and available evidence.
- Tmux session config uses dynamic pane commands that cannot be statically resolved: record the template and flag with `status: dynamic_coordination`.

## Legacy Context (for intent only; never as evidence)
