# PROMPT_Q2

## Goal
Produce `Q2` outputs for phase `Q` with strict schema, explicit evidence, and deterministic normalization.
Focus on coverage, collisions, determinism drift, and recovery actions.

## Inputs
- Source scope (scan these roots first):
- `extraction/**`
- `services/repo-truth-extractor/**`
- `services/registry.yaml`
- `compose.yml`
- `docker-compose*.yml`
- Upstream normalized artifacts available to this step:
- `QA_RUN_MANIFEST.json`
- `QA_MISSING_ARTIFACTS.json`
- Runner context artifacts:
  - `extraction/*/inputs/INVENTORY.json`
  - `extraction/*/inputs/PARTITIONS.json`
  - `services/repo-truth-extractor/promptsets/v4/promptset.yaml`
  - `services/repo-truth-extractor/promptsets/v4/artifacts.yaml`
- When relevant, use `services/registry.yaml` as canonical service list.

## Outputs
- `QA_PROMPT_COLLISIONS.json`

## Schema
- Use deterministic containers only:
  - `ItemList`: `{"schema":"<schema_id>@v1","items":[...]}`
  - `Graph`: `{"schema":"<schema_id>@v1","nodes":[...],"edges":[...]}`
- Output contracts:
  - `QA_PROMPT_COLLISIONS.json`
    - `kind`: `json_item_list`
    - `merge_strategy`: `itemlist_by_id`
    - `canonical_writer_step_id`: `Q2`
    - `id_rule`: `QA_PROMPT_COLLISIONS:<stable-hash(path|symbol|name)>`
    - `required_item_fields`: `id, status, checks, issues, evidence`
    - `required_registry_fields`: `path, line_range, id`

## Extraction Procedure
1. Scan all normalized artifacts for duplicate IDs: within each artifact, check that every `id` field is unique. Across artifacts that share the same `id_rule` prefix, check for cross-artifact ID collisions.
2. Identify prompt collisions: cases where two different extraction prompts produce items with the same ID, indicating overlapping extraction scope or non-deterministic ID generation.
3. For each collision, record: the colliding IDs, the source artifacts, the source prompts/steps, and whether the colliding items have identical or divergent content.
4. Classify collisions by severity: `harmless` (identical content, merge-safe), `conflict` (different content for same ID, requires resolution), or `schema_error` (ID format violates the declared `id_rule`).
5. Legacy Context is intent guidance only and is never evidence.
6. Enumerate candidate facts only from in-scope inputs and upstream artifacts.
7. Build deterministic IDs using stable content keys (path/symbol/name/service_id).
8. Attach evidence to every non-derived field and every relationship edge.
9. Normalize arrays by stable sort keys; deduplicate by ID (or stable content hash).
10. Validate required fields; emit `UNKNOWN` for unsatisfied values with evidence gaps.
11. Emit exactly the declared outputs and no additional files.

## Evidence Rules
- Every load-bearing value must carry at least one evidence object:
```json
{
  "path": "<repo-relative-path>",
  "line_range": [<start>, <end>],
  "excerpt": "<exact substring <=200 chars>"
}
```
- `path` must be repo-relative (never absolute in norm artifacts).
- `excerpt` must be exact (no paraphrase) and <= 200 chars.
- If the source is ambiguous, include multiple evidence objects and set value to `UNKNOWN`.

## Determinism Rules
- Norm outputs MUST NOT contain: `generated_at`, `timestamp`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `run_id`.
- Sort `items` by `(path, line_start, id)` when available; otherwise by `id` then stable JSON text.
- Merge duplicates deterministically:
  - union evidence by `(path,line_range,excerpt)`
  - union arrays with stable sort
  - choose scalar conflicts by non-empty, else lexicographically smallest stable value
- Output byte content must be reproducible for same commit + same configuration.

## Anti-Fabrication Rules
- Do not invent endpoints, handlers, dependencies, env vars, commands, or policy claims.
- Do not infer intent from filenames alone; require direct textual/code evidence.
- If required evidence is missing, keep item with `UNKNOWN` fields and `missing_evidence_reason`.
- Never copy unsupported keys from upstream QA artifacts into norm artifacts.

## Failure Modes
- Missing input files: emit valid empty containers plus `missing_inputs` list in output items.
- Partial scan coverage: emit partial results with explicit `coverage_notes` and evidence gaps.
- Schema violation risk: drop unverifiable fields, keep item `id` + `evidence` + `UNKNOWN` placeholders.
- Parse/runtime ambiguity: keep all plausible candidates but mark `status: needs_review` with evidence.
- ID collision involves items from different phases (e.g., A-phase and C-phase): flag with `status: cross_phase_collision` as this likely indicates an id_rule design issue.
- Duplicate ID caused by non-deterministic ID generation (different runs produce different IDs for same content): flag with `status: nondeterministic_id` and cite the varying inputs.
