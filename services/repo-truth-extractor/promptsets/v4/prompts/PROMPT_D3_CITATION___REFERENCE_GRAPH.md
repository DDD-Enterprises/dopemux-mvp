# PROMPT_D3

## Goal
Produce `D3` outputs for phase `D` with strict schema, explicit evidence, and deterministic normalization.
Focus on concrete, machine-verifiable implementation facts.

## Inputs
- Source scope (scan these roots first):
- `docs/**`
- `README.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `docs/docs_index.yaml`
- Upstream normalized artifacts available to this step:
- `DOC_INVENTORY.json`
- `DOC_PARTITIONS.json`
- `DOC_TODO_QUEUE.json`
- `DOC_INDEX.partX.json`
- `DOC_CONTRACT_CLAIMS.partX.json`
- `DOC_BOUNDARIES.partX.json`
- `DOC_SUPERSESSION.partX.json`
- `CAP_NOTICES.partX.json`
- `DOC_INTERFACES.partX.json`
- `DOC_WORKFLOWS.partX.json`
- `DOC_DECISIONS.partX.json`
- `DOC_GLOSSARY.partX.json`
- Runner context artifacts:
  - `extraction/*/inputs/INVENTORY.json`
  - `extraction/*/inputs/PARTITIONS.json`
  - `services/repo-truth-extractor/promptsets/v4/promptset.yaml`
  - `services/repo-truth-extractor/promptsets/v4/artifacts.yaml`
- When relevant, use `services/registry.yaml` as canonical service list.

## Outputs
- `DOC_CITATION_GRAPH.json`

## Schema
- Use deterministic containers only:
  - `ItemList`: `{"schema":"<schema_id>@v1","items":[...]}`
  - `Graph`: `{"schema":"<schema_id>@v1","nodes":[...],"edges":[...]}`
- Output contracts:
  - `DOC_CITATION_GRAPH.json`
    - `kind`: `json_item_list`
    - `merge_strategy`: `itemlist_by_id`
    - `canonical_writer_step_id`: `D3`
    - `id_rule`: `DOC_CITATION_GRAPH:<stable-hash(path|symbol|name)>`
    - `required_item_fields`: `nodes, edges, schema`
    - `required_registry_fields`: `path, line_range, id`

## Extraction Procedure
1. Scan all indexed documents for explicit cross-references: markdown links (`[text](path)`), file path mentions, `see also` directives, and citation patterns (`as described in <doc>`). For each reference edge, record the source document, target document or path, the reference type (link, mention, citation), and line range evidence.
2. Extract code-path references: documentation that mentions specific source files, function names, class names, or module paths. Build edges from document nodes to code-path nodes with the reference type and evidence.
3. Extract service and config references: documentation mentioning service names (matching `services/registry.yaml` entries), configuration file paths, environment variable names, or compose service names. Build edges to the referenced entities.
4. Compute graph metrics: identify hub documents (highest in-degree), authority documents (highest out-degree), cross-plane edges (references spanning different architectural planes), and orphan documents (no incoming or outgoing references).
5. Cross-reference the citation graph against upstream `DOC_INVENTORY.json` and `DOC_PARTITIONS.json` to validate that all referenced documents exist in the inventory. Flag broken links with `status: broken_reference`.
6. Legacy Context is intent guidance only and is never evidence.
7. Enumerate candidate facts only from in-scope inputs and upstream artifacts.
8. Build deterministic IDs using stable content keys (path/symbol/name/service_id).
9. Attach evidence to every non-derived field and every relationship edge.
10. Normalize arrays by stable sort keys; deduplicate by ID (or stable content hash).
11. Validate required fields; emit `UNKNOWN` for unsatisfied values with evidence gaps.
12. Emit exactly the declared outputs and no additional files.

## Evidence Rules
- Every load-bearing value must carry at least one evidence object:
```json
{
  "path": "<repo-relative-path>",
  "line_range": [<start>, <end>],
  "excerpt": "<exact substring <=200 chars>"
}
```
- `path` must be repo-relative (never absolute in norm artifacts).
- `excerpt` must be exact (no paraphrase) and <= 200 chars.
- If the source is ambiguous, include multiple evidence objects and set value to `UNKNOWN`.

## Determinism Rules
- Norm outputs MUST NOT contain: `generated_at`, `timestamp`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `run_id`.
- Sort `items` by `(path, line_start, id)` when available; otherwise by `id` then stable JSON text.
- Merge duplicates deterministically:
  - union evidence by `(path,line_range,excerpt)`
  - union arrays with stable sort
  - choose scalar conflicts by non-empty, else lexicographically smallest stable value
- Output byte content must be reproducible for same commit + same configuration.

## Anti-Fabrication Rules
- Do not invent endpoints, handlers, dependencies, env vars, commands, or policy claims.
- Do not infer intent from filenames alone; require direct textual/code evidence.
- If required evidence is missing, keep item with `UNKNOWN` fields and `missing_evidence_reason`.
- Never copy unsupported keys from upstream QA artifacts into norm artifacts.

## Failure Modes
- Missing input files: emit valid empty containers plus `missing_inputs` list in output items.
- Partial scan coverage: emit partial results with explicit `coverage_notes` and evidence gaps.
- Schema violation risk: drop unverifiable fields, keep item `id` + `evidence` + `UNKNOWN` placeholders.
- Parse/runtime ambiguity: keep all plausible candidates but mark `status: needs_review` with evidence.
- Reference target is an external URL (not a repo-relative path): emit edge with `target_type: external_url` and the URL as target; do not attempt to validate existence.
- Ambiguous reference that could resolve to multiple documents (e.g., `see the architecture doc`): emit with `target: UNKNOWN` and `status: ambiguous_reference` with evidence.

## Legacy Context (for intent only; never as evidence)
```markdown
Goal: DOC_CITATION_GRAPH.json

Prompt:
- Build graph edges:
  - doc A references doc B (links, filenames, "see also", explicit citations)
  - doc A references code path
  - doc A references service name/config name
- Output top referenced docs, hub docs, cross-plane edges.
```
