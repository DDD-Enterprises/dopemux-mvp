# PROMPT_C7

## Goal
Produce `C7` outputs for phase `C` with strict schema, explicit evidence, and deterministic normalization.
Focus on service runtime truths, interfaces, dependencies, and code-level ownership.

## Inputs
- Source scope (scan these roots first):
- `src/**`
- `services/**`
- `components/**`
- `dashboard/**`
- `plugins/**`
- `ui-dashboard/**`
- `ui-dashboard-backend/**`


- `services/agents/**`
- `src/dopemux/hooks/**`
- `src/dopemux/agent_orchestrator.py`




- `docker/**`
- `compose.yml`
- `docker-compose*.yml`
- `services/registry.yaml`
- Upstream normalized artifacts available to this step:
- `CODE_INVENTORY.json`
- `CODE_PARTITIONS.json`
- `SERVICE_ENTRYPOINTS.json`
- `EVENTBUS_SURFACE.json`
- `EVENT_PRODUCERS.json`
- `EVENT_CONSUMERS.json`
- `DOPE_MEMORY_CODE_SURFACE.json`
- `DOPE_MEMORY_SCHEMAS.json`
- `DOPE_MEMORY_DB_WRITES.json`
- `TRINITY_ENFORCEMENT_SURFACE.json`
- `REFUSAL_AND_GUARDRAILS_SURFACE.json`
- `TASKX_INTEGRATION_SURFACE.json`
- `WORKFLOW_RUNNER_SURFACE.json`
- Runner context artifacts:
  - `extraction/*/inputs/INVENTORY.json`
  - `extraction/*/inputs/PARTITIONS.json`
  - `services/repo-truth-extractor/promptsets/v4/promptset.yaml`
  - `services/repo-truth-extractor/promptsets/v4/artifacts.yaml`
- When relevant, use `services/registry.yaml` as canonical service list.

## Outputs
- `API_DASHBOARD_SURFACE.json`

## Schema
- Use deterministic containers only:
  - `ItemList`: `{"schema":"<schema_id>@v1","items":[...]}`
  - `Graph`: `{"schema":"<schema_id>@v1","nodes":[...],"edges":[...]}`
- Output contracts:
  - `API_DASHBOARD_SURFACE.json`
    - `kind`: `json_item_list`
    - `merge_strategy`: `itemlist_by_id`
    - `canonical_writer_step_id`: `C7`
    - `id_rule`: `API_DASHBOARD_SURFACE:<stable-hash(path|symbol|name)>`
    - `required_item_fields`: `id, component, symbol, path, line_range, evidence`
    - `required_registry_fields`: `path, line_range, id`

## Extraction Procedure
1. Load upstream inventory and partitions; use the API endpoint and dashboard partition as primary scan surface.
2. Extract API routes: scan `src/**` and `services/**` for router definitions (e.g., `APIRouter()`, `Blueprint()`) and route decorators (e.g., `@app.get`, `@router.post`).
3. Identify dashboard definitions: search for UI components in `dashboard/**`, `ui-dashboard/**`, or `components/**` that render system state or metrics.
4. Locate monitoring and health endpoints: search for routes like `/health`, `/metrics`, `/status`, or Prometheus-style exporter configurations.
5. Identify frontend-to-backend mappings: search for `fetch(`, `axios.`, or `api.get(` calls in JavaScript/TypeScript files to identify backend dependencies.
6. Build relationship graph: trace connections between API endpoints and the dashboard components that display their data.
7. Cross-reference with upstream artifacts to identify overrides, shadows, and conflicts in API surface definitions.
8. For each API_DASHBOARD_SURFACES item, populate `id`, required fields, and `evidence`.
9. Legacy Context is intent guidance only and is never evidence.
10. Enumerate candidate facts only from in-scope inputs and upstream artifacts.
11. Build deterministic IDs using stable content keys (path/symbol/name/service_id).
12. Attach evidence to every non-derived field and every relationship edge.
13. Normalize arrays by stable sort keys; deduplicate by ID (or stable content hash).
14. Validate required fields; emit `UNKNOWN` for unsatisfied values with evidence gaps.
15. Emit exactly the declared outputs and no additional files.

## Shared Rules

## Legacy Context (for intent only; never as evidence)
