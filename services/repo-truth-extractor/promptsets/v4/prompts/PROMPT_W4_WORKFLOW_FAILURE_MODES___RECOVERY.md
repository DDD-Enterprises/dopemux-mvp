# PROMPT_W4

## Goal
Produce `W4` outputs for phase `W` with strict schema, explicit evidence, and deterministic normalization.
Focus on executable workflows, runbooks, and multi-service coordination boundaries.

## Inputs
- Source scope (scan these roots first):
- `scripts/**`
- `services/**`
- `docs/02-how-to/**`
- `docs/03-reference/**`
- `compose.yml`
- Upstream normalized artifacts available to this step:
- `WORKFLOW_INVENTORY.json`
- `WORKFLOW_PARTITIONS.json`
- `WORKFLOW_CATALOG.json`
- `WORKFLOW_IO_MAP.json`
- `WORKFLOW_COORDINATION_SURFACE.json`
- Runner context artifacts:
  - `extraction/*/inputs/INVENTORY.json`
  - `extraction/*/inputs/PARTITIONS.json`
  - `services/repo-truth-extractor/promptsets/v4/promptset.yaml`
  - `services/repo-truth-extractor/promptsets/v4/artifacts.yaml`
- When relevant, use `services/registry.yaml` as canonical service list.

## Outputs
- `WORKFLOW_FAILURE_RECOVERY.json`

## Schema
- Use deterministic containers only:
  - `ItemList`: `{"schema":"<schema_id>@v1","items":[...]}`
  - `Graph`: `{"schema":"<schema_id>@v1","nodes":[...],"edges":[...]}`
- Output contracts:
  - `WORKFLOW_FAILURE_RECOVERY.json`
    - `kind`: `json_item_list`
    - `merge_strategy`: `itemlist_by_id`
    - `canonical_writer_step_id`: `W4`
    - `id_rule`: `WORKFLOW_FAILURE_RECOVERY:<stable-hash(path|symbol|name)>`
    - `required_item_fields`: `id, evidence, path, line_range`
    - `required_registry_fields`: `path, line_range, id`

## Extraction Procedure
1. Load upstream W-phase artifacts (inventory, catalog, I/O map, coordination surface) as specified in the inputs section. For each workflow, identify failure modes by analyzing: error handling in scripts (trap, set -e, exit codes), compose restart policies, retry logic, timeout configurations, and documented recovery procedures.
2. For each failure mode, extract: trigger condition, observable symptoms, blast radius (which downstream workflows are affected), and recovery steps (if documented). Classify by severity (data-loss, service-down, degraded, cosmetic).
3. Map failure propagation paths: how a failure in one workflow affects dependent workflows through the I/O and coordination graphs. Identify single points of failure.
4. Structure the output with clear per-workflow failure entries, propagation graph edges with evidence, and an explicit UNKNOWN section for workflows with undocumented or unclear failure handling.
5. Legacy Context is intent guidance only and is never evidence.
6. Enumerate candidate facts only from in-scope inputs and upstream artifacts.
7. Build deterministic IDs using stable content keys (path/symbol/name/service_id).
8. Attach evidence to every non-derived field and every relationship edge.
9. Normalize arrays by stable sort keys; deduplicate by ID (or stable content hash).
10. Validate required fields; emit `UNKNOWN` for unsatisfied values with evidence gaps.
11. Emit exactly the declared outputs and no additional files.

## Evidence Rules
- Every load-bearing value must carry at least one evidence object:
```json
{
  "path": "<repo-relative-path>",
  "line_range": [<start>, <end>],
  "excerpt": "<exact substring <=200 chars>"
}
```
- `path` must be repo-relative (never absolute in norm artifacts).
- `excerpt` must be exact (no paraphrase) and <= 200 chars.
- If the source is ambiguous, include multiple evidence objects and set value to `UNKNOWN`.

## Determinism Rules
- Norm outputs MUST NOT contain: `generated_at`, `timestamp`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `run_id`.
- Sort `items` by `(path, line_start, id)` when available; otherwise by `id` then stable JSON text.
- Merge duplicates deterministically:
  - union evidence by `(path,line_range,excerpt)`
  - union arrays with stable sort
  - choose scalar conflicts by non-empty, else lexicographically smallest stable value
- Output byte content must be reproducible for same commit + same configuration.

## Anti-Fabrication Rules
- Do not invent endpoints, handlers, dependencies, env vars, commands, or policy claims.
- Do not infer intent from filenames alone; require direct textual/code evidence.
- If required evidence is missing, keep item with `UNKNOWN` fields and `missing_evidence_reason`.
- Never copy unsupported keys from upstream QA artifacts into norm artifacts.

## Failure Modes
- Missing input files: emit valid empty containers plus `missing_inputs` list in output items.
- Partial scan coverage: emit partial results with explicit `coverage_notes` and evidence gaps.
- Schema violation risk: drop unverifiable fields, keep item `id` + `evidence` + `UNKNOWN` placeholders.
- Parse/runtime ambiguity: keep all plausible candidates but mark `status: needs_review` with evidence.
- Script has no error handling (no trap, no set -e, no exit code checks): record as `failure_handling: none` with evidence and classify all steps as `blast_radius: unknown`.
- Recovery procedure references external systems or manual interventions not documented in repo: record as `recovery_type: external_manual` with available evidence.
