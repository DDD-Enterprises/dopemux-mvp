# PROMPT_B2

## Goal
Produce `B2` outputs for phase `B` with strict schema, explicit evidence, and deterministic normalization.
Focus on boundary enforcement points, refusal rails, and concrete bypass evidence.

## Inputs
- Source scope (scan these roots first):
- `src/**`
- `services/**`
- `docs/90-adr/**`
- `.claude/**`
- `AGENTS.md`
- Upstream normalized artifacts available to this step:
- `BOUNDARY_INVENTORY.json`
- `BOUNDARY_PARTITIONS.json`
- `BOUNDARY_ENFORCEMENT_POINTS.json`
- Runner context artifacts:
  - `extraction/*/inputs/INVENTORY.json`
  - `extraction/*/inputs/PARTITIONS.json`
  - `services/repo-truth-extractor/promptsets/v4/promptset.yaml`
  - `services/repo-truth-extractor/promptsets/v4/artifacts.yaml`
- When relevant, use `services/registry.yaml` as canonical service list.

## Outputs
- `REFUSAL_GUARDRAILS_SURFACE.json`

## Schema
- Use deterministic containers only:
  - `ItemList`: `{"schema":"<schema_id>@v1","items":[...]}`
  - `Graph`: `{"schema":"<schema_id>@v1","nodes":[...],"edges":[...]}`
- Output contracts:
  - `REFUSAL_GUARDRAILS_SURFACE.json`
    - `kind`: `json_item_list`
    - `merge_strategy`: `itemlist_by_id`
    - `canonical_writer_step_id`: `B2`
    - `id_rule`: `REFUSAL_GUARDRAILS_SURFACE:<stable-hash(path|symbol|name)>`
    - `required_item_fields`: `id, component, symbol, path, line_range, evidence`
    - `required_registry_fields`: `path, line_range, id`

## Extraction Procedure
1. Load upstream B0 and B1 artifacts to identify known boundary enforcement points and their locations.
2. Scan for refusal patterns: identify code paths that explicitly deny, reject, or refuse requests (HTTP 403/401, exception raises, early returns with error messages). Record the refusal condition and response with evidence.
3. Extract guardrail configurations: rate limiters, input validators, size limits, content filters, and safety checks. Record threshold values, enforcement locations, and configuration sources.
4. Map each guardrail to the boundary it enforces by cross-referencing with B1 enforcement points. Identify guardrails that operate independently of declared boundaries.
5. Legacy Context is intent guidance only and is never evidence.
6. Enumerate candidate facts only from in-scope inputs and upstream artifacts.
7. Build deterministic IDs using stable content keys (path/symbol/name/service_id).
8. Attach evidence to every non-derived field and every relationship edge.
9. Normalize arrays by stable sort keys; deduplicate by ID (or stable content hash).
10. Validate required fields; emit `UNKNOWN` for unsatisfied values with evidence gaps.
11. Emit exactly the declared outputs and no additional files.

## Evidence Rules
- Every load-bearing value must carry at least one evidence object:
```json
{
  "path": "<repo-relative-path>",
  "line_range": [<start>, <end>],
  "excerpt": "<exact substring <=200 chars>"
}
```
- `path` must be repo-relative (never absolute in norm artifacts).
- `excerpt` must be exact (no paraphrase) and <= 200 chars.
- If the source is ambiguous, include multiple evidence objects and set value to `UNKNOWN`.

## Determinism Rules
- Norm outputs MUST NOT contain: `generated_at`, `timestamp`, `created_at`, `updated_at`, `run_id`.
- Sort `items` by `(path, line_start, id)` when available; otherwise by `id` then stable JSON text.
- Merge duplicates deterministically:
  - union evidence by `(path,line_range,excerpt)`
  - union arrays with stable sort
  - choose scalar conflicts by non-empty, else lexicographically smallest stable value
- Output byte content must be reproducible for same commit + same configuration.

## Anti-Fabrication Rules
- Do not invent endpoints, handlers, dependencies, env vars, commands, or policy claims.
- Do not infer intent from filenames alone; require direct textual/code evidence.
- If required evidence is missing, keep item with `UNKNOWN` fields and `missing_evidence_reason`.
- Never copy unsupported keys from upstream QA artifacts into norm artifacts.

## Failure Modes
- Missing input files: emit valid empty containers plus `missing_inputs` list in output items.
- Partial scan coverage: emit partial results with explicit `coverage_notes` and evidence gaps.
- Schema violation risk: drop unverifiable fields, keep item `id` + `evidence` + `UNKNOWN` placeholders.
- Parse/runtime ambiguity: keep all plausible candidates but mark `status: needs_review` with evidence.
- Guardrail with configurable threshold but no evidence of the configured value: emit with threshold set to `UNKNOWN` and evidence citing the config reference without resolved value.
- Refusal pattern detected in dead code or unreachable paths: emit with `status: unreachable` and evidence explaining why the path appears unused.
