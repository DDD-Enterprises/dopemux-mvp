# PROMPT_R0

## Goal
Produce `R0` outputs for phase `R` with strict schema, explicit evidence, and deterministic normalization.
Focus on concrete, machine-verifiable implementation facts.

## Inputs
- Source scope (scan these roots first):
- `extraction/**/norm/**`
- `docs/**`
- `services/repo-truth-extractor/**`
- Upstream normalized artifacts available to this step:
- None; this step can rely on phase inventory inputs.
- Runner context artifacts:
  - `extraction/*/inputs/INVENTORY.json`
  - `extraction/*/inputs/PARTITIONS.json`
  - `services/repo-truth-extractor/promptsets/v4/promptset.yaml`
  - `services/repo-truth-extractor/promptsets/v4/artifacts.yaml`
- When relevant, use `services/registry.yaml` as canonical service list.

## Outputs
- `CONTROL_PLANE_TRUTH_MAP.md`

## Schema
- Use deterministic containers only:
  - `ItemList`: `{"schema":"<schema_id>@v1","items":[...]}`
  - `Graph`: `{"schema":"<schema_id>@v1","nodes":[...],"edges":[...]}`
- Output contracts:
  - `CONTROL_PLANE_TRUTH_MAP.md`
    - `kind`: `markdown`
    - `merge_strategy`: `markdown_concat`
    - `canonical_writer_step_id`: `R0`
    - `id_rule`: `CONTROL_PLANE_TRUTH_MAP:<stable-hash(path|symbol|name)>`
    - `required_item_fields`: `id, evidence`

## Extraction Procedure
1. Load Phase A, H, D, and C normalized artifacts from `extraction/**/norm/`.
2. Map **Repo Control Plane**: Extract `instruction_surfaces`, `hooks`, `compose`, `router`, `litellm`, and `mcp` definitions from Phase A/C.
3. Map **Home Control Plane**: Extract `configs`, `router`, `litellm`, `mcp`, and `sqlite` metadata from Phase H.
4. Construct **Invocation Graph**: Trace triggers from repo instructions to service startup (Compose/Tmux).
5. Identify **Coupling Points**: Match control-plane configs to code entrypoints (Phase C).
6. Flag **Portability Risks**: Identify hardcoded machine paths or non-portable environment dependencies.
7. Arbitration: If A/D (Intent) conflicts with C (Implementation), mark `status: conflict` and cite both.
8. Legacy Context is intent guidance only and is never evidence.
7. Enumerate candidate facts only from in-scope inputs and upstream artifacts.
8. Build deterministic IDs using stable content keys (path/symbol/name/service_id).
9. Attach evidence to every non-derived field and every relationship edge.
10. Normalize arrays by stable sort keys; deduplicate by ID (or stable content hash).
11. Validate required fields; emit `UNKNOWN` for unsatisfied values with evidence gaps.
12. Emit exactly the declared outputs and no additional files.

## Shared Rules
Refer to `PROMPTSET_RULES.md` for Evidence, Determinism, Anti-Fabrication, and Failure Mode protocols.

## Legacy Context (for intent only; never as evidence)
```markdown
Goal: CONTROL_PLANE_TRUTH_MAP.md

ROLE: Supervisor/Auditor. Evidence-first.
HARD RULE: Reason only from Phase A/H/D/C normalized artifacts. If evidence is missing, write UNKNOWN and name the missing artifact.

TASK:
Produce the repo/home control-plane truth map.

MUST INCLUDE:
- Repo control plane surfaces (instructions, hooks, compose, router, litellm, mcp)
- Home control plane surfaces (configs, router, litellm, mcp, sqlite state)
- Invocation graph (what starts what)
- Control-plane to runtime coupling points
- Portability risks

RULES:
- Cite every claim with REPOCTRL:/HOMECTRL:/CODE:/DOC references.
- No repo rescans. No implementation changes.
- Label unevidenced statements UNKNOWN.
```
