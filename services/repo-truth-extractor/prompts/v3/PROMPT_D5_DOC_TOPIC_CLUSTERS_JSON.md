OUTPUTS:
- DOC_TOPIC_CLUSTERS.json

Hard rules:
- Output JSON only. No prose, markdown fences, commentary, or multiple JSON objects.
- Treat the runner context as line-numbered evidence. Every cited line_range MUST use the line numbers shown in the provided excerpt.
- Every items[] entry MUST include id, path, and line_range.
- Every evidence object MUST include repo-relative path, integer line_range, and exact excerpt.
- If a value cannot be grounded from the provided excerpt, return valid JSON with UNKNOWN or fail-closed placeholders; never invent line numbers.

Goal: DOC_TOPIC_CLUSTERS.json

Prompt:
- Input: merged docs index (plus optionally raw text samples).
- Cluster by token overlap (no semantic labeling).
- Output:
  - cluster_id
  - doc_paths
  - top_tokens (weighted)
  - doc_count
  - newest_mtime + oldest_mtime (for recency awareness)
- No "this cluster is architecture" labeling.
