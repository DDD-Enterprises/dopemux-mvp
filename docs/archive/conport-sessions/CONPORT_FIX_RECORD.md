# ConPort MCP Server Fix Record

**Date**: September 26, 2025
**Status**: ✅ **PERMANENTLY RESOLVED**

## Problem Summary

ConPort MCP server was failing with "Failed to reconnect to conport" errors, preventing critical ADHD session memory functionality.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issues Found

1. **Duplicate Conflicting Configurations** (Critical)
   - Global config with invalid `"command": "stdio"`
   - Project config with correct path and workspace_id
   - The broken global config was overriding the working project config

2. **Process Instability in Stdio Mode**
   - Database pre-warming causing high CPU usage (96.5%) in stdio mode
   - Process crashes during MCP management
   - Manual tests worked fine, indicating MCP-specific issue

3. **Multiple Installation Conflicts**
   - System-wide uv installation conflicting with project venv
   - Various worktree copies causing confusion

## Solution Implemented

### Phase 1: Configuration Fix

- ✅ Removed broken global conport config from `.claude.json`
- ✅ Recreated clean MCP configurations using `claude mcp add-json`
- ✅ Verified correct project config with proper workspace_id

**Correct Configuration**:

```json
"conport": {
  "type": "stdio",
  "command": "/Users/hue/code/dopemux-mvp/services/conport/venv/bin/conport-mcp",
  "args": ["--mode", "stdio", "--workspace_id", "/Users/hue/code/dopemux-mvp"]
}
```

### Phase 2: Installation Cleanup

- ✅ Removed system-wide uv installation: `uv tool uninstall context-portal-mcp`
- ✅ Verified only project venv installation remains

### Phase 3: Process Stability Fix

- ✅ Added stdio mode bypass in `main.py:977-987`
- ✅ Skip database pre-warming when `args.mode == "stdio"`
- ✅ Prevent high CPU usage and process crashes under MCP management

**Code Change**:

```python
# Skip pre-warming in stdio mode to prevent high CPU usage and process crashes
if effective_workspace_id and args.mode != "stdio":
    # Pre-warming logic for HTTP mode only
elif args.mode == "stdio":
    log.info("Skipping database pre-warming in stdio mode for MCP compatibility and process stability.")
```

### Phase 4: Validation

- ✅ `claude mcp list` shows "✓ Connected"
- ✅ Manual stdio test starts cleanly without CPU spikes
- ✅ No process crashes or hanging during startup

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check MCP status
claude mcp list

# Test manual startup (should not hang or spike CPU)
timeout 10s /Users/hue/code/dopemux-mvp/services/conport/venv/bin/conport-mcp \
  --mode stdio --workspace_id /Users/hue/code/dopemux-mvp

# Verify no system-wide conflicts
which conport-mcp  # Should return "not found"
```

## Prevention Measures

### CLAUDE.md Integration

Added to project CLAUDE.md:

- ConPort configuration requirements
- Warning about duplicate config conflicts
- Proper workspace_id setup instructions

### Future Troubleshooting

1. **Always check for duplicate configs** if conport fails
2. **Use project venv, not system-wide installations**
3. **Stdio mode bypass is essential** for MCP stability
4. **Test both `claude mcp list` and manual startup** for validation

## Impact

✅ **ADHD Session Memory Restored**: Critical context preservation functionality operational
✅ **Process Stability**: No more high CPU usage or crashes
✅ **Clean Configuration**: Single, correct MCP config without conflicts
✅ **Future-Proof**: Documented prevention measures and troubleshooting steps

## Files Modified

1. `/Users/hue/.claude.json` - Recreated clean MCP configurations
2. `/Users/hue/code/dopemux-mvp/services/conport/src/context_portal_mcp/main.py` - Added stdio bypass
3. `/Users/hue/code/dopemux-mvp/.conport/CONPORT_FIX_RECORD.md` - This documentation
