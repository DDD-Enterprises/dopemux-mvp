```

## 🔄 Agent Coordination Patterns

### Standard Handoff Workflows

#### 1. Strategic to Implementation

```
Architect Agent (design)
    → Project Manager Agent (coordination)
    → Developer Agent (implementation)
```

#### 2. Research to Decision

```
Researcher Agent (analysis)
    → Architect Agent (design decision)
    → Project Manager Agent (sprint integration)
```

#### 3. Implementation to Coordination

```
Developer Agent (progress/blockers)
    → Project Manager Agent (coordination)
    → [Resolution path based on issue type]
```

### Cross-Plane Coordination

#### PM Plane → Cognitive Plane

1. **Strategic Requirements** (Task-Master) → **Project Manager Agent**
2. **Coordination Planning** → **Architect Agent** (technical feasibility)
3. **Implementation Specification** → **Developer Agent** (execution)

#### Cognitive Plane → PM Plane

1. **Technical Progress** (Developer Agent) → **Project Manager Agent**
2. **Status Coordination** → **Integration Bridge** → **Leantime**
3. **Decision Logging** → **ConPort** (memory preservation)

## 🧠 ADHD-Optimized Agent Behaviors

### Context Preservation

- All agents automatically save state before handoffs
- Mental model preservation across interruptions
- Clear bridging summaries during agent transitions
- ConPort integration for persistent memory

### Attention Management

- Agents adapt response complexity to user's attention state
- Progressive disclosure: essential info first, details on request
- Visual progress indicators and completion celebrations
- Gentle guidance with encouraging, supportive language

### Cognitive Load Reduction

- Maximum 3 options presented in any decision
- Single clear next action when attention is scattered
- Automatic tool selection based on agent specialization
- Smart context pruning to essential information

## ⚙️ Technical Implementation

### Agent Invocation Patterns

```bash
# Direct agent usage (when agent type is clear)
"I need to implement X feature" → Developer Agent
"What's the best architecture for Y?" → Architect Agent
"Research technology Z" → Researcher Agent
"Plan next sprint" → Project Manager Agent

# Mode-based routing (when work type is ambiguous)
Current Mode: PLAN → Architect/Project Manager Agents prioritized
Current Mode: ACT → Developer Agent prioritized

# Attention-based adaptation (automatic)
Scattered → Fast models, minimal context, single actions
Focused → Balanced models, structured detail, multiple options
Hyperfocus → Premium models, comprehensive analysis, full context
```

## 🎯 Usage Guidelines

### When to Use Multiple Agents

- **Complex Projects**: Coordinate across agents for comprehensive approach
- **Learning Scenarios**: Research → Architect → Developer progression
- **Quality Assurance**: Developer → Architect review cycles
- **Strategic Planning**: Project Manager orchestration of all agents

### When to Stick with Single Agent

- **Clear Specialization**: Task clearly fits one agent's expertise
